# 1) Data Structures
I did not use complex data structures but I have the variables

a) minh, maxh, and totalh = stores the minimum, maximum and totalh of the input 
b) count = keeps track of the data points which will help in finding the avg height


# 2) source files:

a)  pointcloud.c

    - stat1():  reads the pointcloud data then finds the min, max and avg height. If scanf() reads 3 values initialize minh, max, totalh with the first height values
                while --> goes intil it can not scan 3 values, update minh if the new height is largerm also adding the totalh and increment the count.

    - main(): entry point of the program and then it calls main()

    pointcloud.h

    - has the function of stat1() to help link the program 


# 3) Functions

    - void stat1(): reads the pointcloud data then finds the min, max and avg height. If scanf() reads 3 values initialize minh, max, totalh with the first height values
                while --> goes intil it can not scan 3 values, update minh if the new height is largerm also adding the totalh and increment the count.
    Input: input from a files
    Output: print the min, max and avg height

    Variables:
        minh = Tracks the smallest height 
        maxh = tracks the largest height 
        totalh = sum of all heights for finding the avg 
        count = nb of prints processed

    - int main(): calls stat1() to finish the main part of the program and then returns.
