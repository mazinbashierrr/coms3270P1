# 1) Data Structures
I did not use complex data structures but I have the variables

a) minh, maxh, and totalh = stores the minimum, maximum and totalh of the input 
b) count = keeps track of the data points which will help in finding the avg height
c) amwater= storing the amount of water
d) n,s,e,w= pointers to the nieghboring points for the simulation
# 2) source files:

a)  pointcloud.c

    - stat1():  reads the pointcloud data then finds the min, max and avg height. If scanf() reads 3 values initialize minh, max, totalh with the first height values
                while --> goes intil it can not scan 3 values, update minh if the new height is largerm also adding the totalh and increment the count.

    - main(): entry point of the program and then it calls main()

b)    pointcloud.h

    - has the function of stat1() to help link the program 

c)  - readpointcloud(): stores each points data in a list
    - sets up the neighbors to sumulate the wayer flow 

c) imagePointCloud:

creates a bitmap on the height and water data
converts it to rgb values
daves it as output.bmp



b) pointcloud.h
    - declares stat1 that will allow it to be used across the files


# 3) Functions

    - void stat1(): reads the pointcloud data then finds the min, max and avg height. If scanf() reads 3 values initialize minh, max, totalh with the first height values
                while --> goes intil it can not scan 3 values, update minh if the new height is largerm also adding the totalh and increment the count.
    Input: input from a files
    Output: print the min, max and avg height

    Variables:
        minh = Tracks the smallest height 
        maxh = tracks the largest height 
        totalh = sum of all heights for finding the avg 
        count = nb of prints processed

    - int main(): calls stat1() to finish the main part of the program and then returns.

    
    -void readPointCloudData(FILE *stream, List *list)

    Reads point cloud data from a file and stores it in a list structure.
    Also sets up neighbor relationships between points.
